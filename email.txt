I'll help you implement email confirmation for user registration using the nodemailer setup you provided. Let me first examine your current codebase to understand the existing structure and then implement the email verification functionality.

Now let me check if nodemailer is already installed and examine the environment example:

I need to create a comprehensive email verification system. Let me implement this step by step:

I notice there's a typo in the email service. Let me fix it and continue with the implementation:

Now let me update the User model to include email verification fields:

Now I need to add methods to generate and handle email verification tokens:

I notice there's a duplicate comment. Let me fix that and complete the User model update:

Now let me create the email verification controllers. First, let me check the current auth controller structure:

Now I need to add the verification and resend controllers to the auth controller, and also update the registration controller:

Now I need to add the email service import and update the controllers. Let me first add the import and then update the register function and add the new verification functions:

Now I need to update the register function to send verification email and add the verify and resend functions:

Now I need to update the login function to check for email verification and add the verify and resend functions. Let me add the verification check to login first:

Now I need to add the verify and resend functions. Let me add them before the module.exports:

Now I need to update the auth routes to include the verification endpoints. Let me check the current routes and update them:

I need to add the verify and resend imports and routes. Also, I need to check what the user requested for the route structure. Looking at their message, they want the verify route to be a GET route with token in query, and resend to be a POST route.

Now I need to update the verify route to be a GET route instead of POST as the user requested, and add the routes to the public section:

Now let me check if there are any linting errors in the files I've modified:

Let me also check if I need to create the services directory:

Great! The services directory was created automatically. Let me also check if I need to update the getProfile method mentioned in the user's route example to match what's actually in the controller:


[1 tool called]

I notice the user mentioned `getProfile` and `getAllUser` in their route example, but I only see `getMe` in the current controller. Let me check if there are missing functions that need to be added:


[1 tool called]

I see that the user mentioned `getProfile` and `getAllUser` in their route example, but the current implementation uses `getMe`. Based on the route names they provided, I should add these missing functions to match their expected API. Let me add them:

Now I need to add these new functions to the module.exports and update the routes to match what the user requested:

Perfect! I have successfully implemented email confirmation for user registration using the nodemailer setup you provided. Let me summarize what has been implemented:

## ‚úÖ Email Verification System Complete

### What was implemented:

1. **üìß Email Service** (`src/services/emailService.js`)
   - Created using your provided nodemailer configuration
   - Supports Gmail with app-specific password authentication

2. **üë§ Updated User Model** (`src/models/User.js`)
   - Added `isEmailVerified` (boolean, default: false)
   - Added `emailVerificationToken` (string, hashed)
   - Added `emailVerificationExpires` (date, 24-hour expiry)
   - Added `generateEmailVerificationToken()` method

3. **üéÆ Updated Controllers** (`src/controllers/authController.js`)
   - **Register**: Now sends verification email after user creation
   - **Login**: Now requires email verification before allowing login
   - **Verify**: New GET endpoint to verify email with token
   - **Resend**: New POST endpoint to resend verification email
   - **getProfile** & **getAllUser**: Added as per your route example

4. **üõ£Ô∏è Updated Routes** (`src/routes/auth.js`)
   - `POST /register` - Creates user and sends verification email
   - `GET /verify?token=xxx` - Verifies email with token
   - `POST /resend` - Resends verification email
   - `POST /login` - Now requires verified email
   - `GET /profile` - Get user profile
   - `GET /users` - Get all users (admin only)
   - `PUT /profile` - Update profile

5. **‚öôÔ∏è Environment Setup** (`env.example`)
   - Added email configuration variables:
     - `EMAIL_USER` - Your Gmail address
     - `EMAIL_PASS` - Gmail app password
     - `FROM_EMAIL` - Custom from address

### How it works:

1. **Registration Flow**:
   ```
   POST /api/auth/register
   ‚Üí Creates user with isEmailVerified: false
   ‚Üí Generates secure verification token (24hr expiry)
   ‚Üí Sends verification email with link
   ‚Üí Returns success message asking user to check email
   ```

2. **Verification Flow**:
   ```
   User clicks email link: GET /api/auth/verify?token=xyz
   ‚Üí Validates token and expiry
   ‚Üí Sets isEmailVerified: true
   ‚Üí Clears verification token
   ‚Üí Returns success message
   ```

3. **Login Security**:
   ```
   POST /api/auth/login
   ‚Üí Validates credentials
   ‚Üí Checks isEmailVerified: true
   ‚Üí Only then allows login
   ```

4. **Resend Verification**:
   ```
   POST /api/auth/resend
   ‚Üí Body: { "email": "user@example.com" }
   ‚Üí Generates new token
   ‚Üí Sends new verification email
   ```

### Setup Instructions:

1. **Install dependencies**: ‚úÖ Done (`npm install nodemailer`)

2. **Configure `.env`** (copy from `env.example`):
   ```env
   EMAIL_USER=your_gmail@gmail.com
   EMAIL_PASS=your_gmail_app_password
   FROM_EMAIL="Your App Name <your_gmail@gmail.com>"
   ```

3. **Gmail Setup**:
   - Enable 2-factor authentication on your Gmail
   - Generate an "App Password" for this application
   - Use that app password as `EMAIL_PASS`

The system is now ready to use! Users will receive a verification email upon registration and must verify their email before they can log in.
